`torchlogix` is a `PyTorch`-based library for training and inference of **logic neural networks**. These solve machine learning tasks by learning combinations of boolean logic expressions. As the choice of boolean expressions is conventionally non-differentiable, relaxations are applied to allow training with gradient-based methods. The final model can be discretized again, resulting in a fully boolean expression with extremely efficient inference, e.g., beyond a million images of MNIST per second on CPU.

**Note:** `torchlogix` is based on the `difflogic` package ([https://github.com/Felix-Petersen/difflogic/](https://github.com/Felix-Petersen/difflogic/)), and extends it by new concepts such as additional layer types, compact parametrizations, higher-dimensional logic blocks, learnable connections and binarization as described in "WARP Logic Neural Networks" (Paper @ [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03527)). It also implements a graph-based intermediate representation (IR) for efficient compilation to different targets (currently FPGA & CPU).

## Installation
```shell
pip install torchlogix                 # basic
pip install "torchlogix[dev]"          # with dev tools
```
The following software stacks have validated performance:
`python3.12` / `python3.13`, `cuda12.4` / `cuda13.0`, `torch2.6` / `torch2.9`.

## Quickstart
`torchlogix` provides learnable logic layers with `torch.nn`-like API. For example, a very simple convolutional model for MNIST can be defined like so:
```python
import torch
from torchlogix.layers import LogicDense, LogicConv2d, OrPooling2d, GroupSum, FixedBinarization

model = torch.nn.Sequential(
    # Every pixel is False (=0) or True (>0). Standard practice on MNIST
    FixedBinarization(thresholds=[0.0]),
    # Convolution w/ 16 kernels - 4 inputs each, randomly drawn from a 3x3 receptive field
    LogicConv2d(in_dim=28, channels=1, num_kernels=16, tree_depth=2, receptive_field_size=3),
    # Reduce dimensionality with pooling operation
    OrPooling2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0),
    torch.nn.Flatten(),
    # Two randomly connected dense layers w/ 4000 neurons
    LogicDense(16*13*13, 4_000),
    LogicDense(4_000, 4_000),
    # Output 10 logits via group sum (scaled by 1/8 for smoothness)
    GroupSum(k=10, tau=8)
)
```
Like ordinary PyTorch neural networks, this model may be trained, e.g., with `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`. The Adam optimizer with a learning rate of `0.01` works well. Every layer and hence the entire model can be switched between the relaxed trainable and discrete, fully boolean version with the standard `model.train()` / `model.eval()` commands. Furthermore, there is a dedicated `model.set_export_mode()`, which expresses the forward path as pure boolean- and indexing operations. This can be represented as a fully unrolled combinational `Circuit`, which can be compiled for fast inference:
```python
from torchlogix import Circuit
circuit = Circuit.from_model(model, input_shape=(1, 28, 28))
circuit.compile()
preds = circuit(X_np, use_compiled=True)  # ~6 ms for 100k images on my laptop
```
The graph-based IR of a `Circuit` can be simplified and emit `C` and `Verilog` code directly:
```python
circuit.simplify()  # removes dead code, folds constants, does dedup...
circuit.get_c_code()
circuit.get_verilog_code()
```

The full training- and evaluation of the model above is demonstrated in the example notebook [examples/mnist_example.ipynb](examples/mnist_example.ipynb).

`torchlogix` is integrated with the 3rd party tool `alkaid` for more advanced FPGA compiling. For more details, see [docs/guides/hardware_deployment.md](docs/guides/hardware_deployment.md).

- **[Hardware Deployment](docs/guides/hardware_deployment.md)** - Compile `torchlogix` models to hardware, via `Circuit` or `alkaid`
- **[Concepts](docs/guides/concepts.md)** - Understand some of the design choices behind `torchlogix`

## Experiments

Various experiments can be run using the script `experiments/train.py`. For example, the medium-sized convolutional model on CIFAR-10 from the paper  "Convolutional Differentiable Logic Gate Networks" (Paper @ [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04732)), can be trained like so:
```
python train.py --dataset cifar-10 -a ClgnCifar10Medium --connections-init-method random-unique -lr 0.02 -wd 0.002 --device cuda --compile-model
```
This achieves 70% discrete test accurcay within 30 minutes on an `A100`, which can be increased further with data augmentation, and knowledge distillation but details of the training procedure are beyond the scope of this package.
